// Problem #1045 [Medium]
// This problem was asked by Microsoft.
// Describe and give an example of each of the following types of polymorphism:

// Ad-hoc polymorphism
// Parametric polymorphism
// Subtype polymorphism

// ad-hoc polymorphism is when you have a function that takes a parameter, and then you can use
// that parameter to call a different function based on the value of that parameter.

// parametric polymorphism is when you have a function that takes a parameter, and then you can use
// that parameter to call a different function based on the type of that parameter.

// subtype polymorphism is when you have a function that takes a parameter, and then you can use that
// parameter to call a different function based on the type of that parameter.
// For example, if you have a function that takes a string, and then you can use that string to call
// a different function based on the string.
